## Introduction

This document outlines security best practices and guidelines specifically tailored for the ShopMe WhatsApp E-commerce platform. As a system that handles sensitive customer data, payment information, and operates through WhatsApp, ShopMe requires a comprehensive security approach to protect both the business and customer data.

## Security Categories

- **Data Protection**
- **Authentication & Authorization** 
- **API Security**
- **WhatsApp Integration Security**
- **Payment Processing**
- **Session Management**
- **Input/Output Validation**
- **Infrastructure Security**
- **Logging & Monitoring**
- **Compliance**

## Recommendations

### Data Protection

#### Encryption at Rest
- **Implement AES-256 encryption** for all sensitive data stored in the database
- **Use separate encryption keys** for different data categories (customer data, payment info)
- **Implement secure key management** with regular key rotation and secure storage
- **Encrypt database backups** with separate keys from the production environment

#### Encryption in Transit
- **Enforce HTTPS** for all connections to the application
- **Implement TLS 1.3** or at minimum TLS 1.2 for all data transfers
- **Use secure WebSockets** (WSS) for real-time communications
- **Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)** to prevent downgrade attacks

#### Data Pseudonymization
- **Implement tokenization** for personal data sent to external services
- **Use data pseudonymization** when sending customer information to OpenRouter/LLMs
- **Create a mapping system** that replaces identifiers with non-sensitive tokens
- **Ensure personal data remains** on ShopMe servers, never exposing to third parties

#### Data Minimization
- **Collect only necessary information** for business operations
- **Implement data retention policies** with automatic purging of old data
- **Use field-level encryption** for particularly sensitive information
- **Provide transparency** to users regarding what data is collected and why

### Authentication & Authorization

#### User Authentication
- **Implement MFA** for administrator and operator accounts
- **Use JWT with appropriate expiration times** (short-lived access tokens, longer refresh tokens)
- **Store tokens securely** using HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks
- **Invalidate sessions** on password changes and suspicious activities

#### Authorization Controls
- **Implement role-based access control (RBAC)** with principle of least privilege
- **Enforce workspace isolation** to prevent cross-tenant data access
- **Validate authorization** for every API request
- **Implement activity logging** for sensitive operations

#### Password Security
- **Enforce strong password policies** (minimum length, complexity, etc.)
- **Use adaptive hashing algorithms** like Argon2 or bcrypt with appropriate work factors
- **Prevent credential stuffing** with rate limiting and CAPTCHA challenges
- **Implement secure password reset workflows** with time-limited tokens

### API Security

#### Rate Limiting
- **Implement tiered rate limiting** based on endpoint sensitivity
- **Apply per-user and per-IP rate limits** to prevent abuse
- **Use an increasing delay strategy** for failed authentication attempts
- **Return appropriate status codes** (429 Too Many Requests) with Retry-After headers

#### Input Validation
- **Validate all input parameters** against expected data types, formats, and ranges
- **Implement whitelist validation** rather than blacklist
- **Use schema validation** for request payloads (JSON Schema, Joi, etc.)
- **Validate content types** to prevent request size limit bypass attacks

#### API Documentation and Security
- **Keep API documentation private** and accessible only to authorized users
- **Implement adequate CORS policies** to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests
- **Use API versioning** to manage security changes over time
- **Remove or disable unused endpoints** to reduce attack surface

### WhatsApp Integration Security

#### WhatsApp API Authentication
- **Securely store WhatsApp API credentials** using a vault service or encrypted storage
- **Implement certificate pinning** for WhatsApp API communications
- **Rotate WhatsApp webhook tokens** periodically
- **Validate incoming webhook requests** using signature verification

#### Message Security
- **Validate all incoming message content** before processing
- **Implement message flooding protection** to prevent DoS attacks
- **Set up spam detection algorithms** to identify abusive patterns
- **Establish secure mechanisms** for handling sensitive data in messages

#### Privacy Controls
- **Provide clear opt-in/opt-out mechanisms** for marketing communications
- **Respect WhatsApp's terms of service** regarding messaging frequency and content
- **Implement chat history deletion features** for users
- **Use secure time-limited links** for sensitive operations instead of exchanging data directly in chat

### Payment Processing

#### Secure Payment Handling
- **Never store complete payment card details** in your database
- **Use time-limited secure links** for payment processing
- **Implement PCI DSS requirements** if handling card data directly
- **Consider using established payment processors** to reduce compliance burden

#### Transaction Security
- **Generate unique transaction IDs** for each payment attempt
- **Implement idempotency keys** to prevent duplicate transactions
- **Perform transaction verification** through multiple factors
- **Set up automatic flagging** of suspicious transaction patterns

#### Secure Links and Tokens
- **Use one-hour security tokens** for payment links
- **Implement single-use tokens** for each transaction
- **Apply IP-based validation** when processing payments
- **Include built-in expiration for all payment links**

### Session Management

#### Session Controls
- **Set appropriate session timeouts** for different user roles
- **Implement secure session storage** that's resistant to session fixation
- **Generate cryptographically secure session IDs**
- **Rotate session IDs** after successful authentication

#### Cookie Security
- **Use HTTP-Only flags** for all session cookies
- **Set Secure flag** to ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS
- **Implement SameSite=Strict** attribute to prevent CSRF
- **Set appropriate Domain and Path** attributes to limit cookie scope

### Input/Output Validation

#### Input Sanitization
- **Sanitize all user inputs** to prevent injection attacks
- **Implement context-specific encoding** for various data outputs
- **Use parameterized queries** for database operations
- **Validate file uploads** for content type, size, and malware

#### Output Encoding
