# OpenAI API Integration Fix

## Problem

The WhatsApp messaging system was failing with authentication errors when trying to use the OpenAI API. The system was using a placeholder API key (`your-api-key-here`) instead of a valid API key, resulting in authentication failures.

## Solution

1. Updated the OpenAI client configuration to work with OpenRouter as an alternative:
   ```typescript
   const openai = new OpenAI({
     apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
     baseURL: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
     defaultHeaders: {
       "HTTP-Referer": "https://laltroitalia.shop",
     },
   });
   ```

2. Updated the model specification to use OpenRouter's format:
   ```typescript
   model: "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo"
   ```

3. Improved the API key validation to be more lenient about key formats:
   ```typescript
   function isOpenAIConfigured() {
     const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
     return apiKey && apiKey.length > 10 && apiKey !== 'your-api-key-here';
   }
   ```

4. Added better error handling and logging throughout the message flow

## Configuration

To enable the AI features, you need to set the following in your `.env` file:

```
# For OpenAI API directly
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here

# OR for OpenRouter (with different key format)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-or-your-openrouter-key-here
```

Without a valid API key, the system will gracefully fall back to a message indicating that an operator will contact the customer soon.

## Testing

After configuring the API key, send a test message via WhatsApp. The system should either:
1. Process the message with AI and return an appropriate response
2. Return a fallback message if the API key is invalid or not configured

Check the logs for detailed information about the message processing flow.
