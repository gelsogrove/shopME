## 🔄 In Progress Tasks

*No tasks currently in progress*

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Test the system** to ensure events functionality is completely removed
2. **Verify all business types** (Shop, Hotel, Restaurant) work correctly
3. **Update any remaining documentation** if needed

## 📋 Pending Tasks

### General Platform
- Complete OWASP security audit
- Optimize database queries for large datasets
- Implement comprehensive logging system

## 🚫 Blocked Tasks

None currently.

## 📝 Notes

- **IMPORTANT**: The real problem was mock data sharing, not backend filtering
- The backend service was already correctly filtering by workspace
- Frontend now properly handles API failures without showing shared data
- All events are guaranteed to be isolated by workspace
- The architecture follows DDD principles with proper separation of concerns

## 🧪 Test Coverage

### Event Workspace Isolation Tests
- ✅ `getAllForWorkspace` filters correctly by workspace
- ✅ `getById` requires both event ID and workspace ID
- ✅ `create` enforces workspace ID requirement
- ✅ `update` only works within the same workspace
- ✅ `delete` only works within the same workspace
- ✅ Cross-workspace isolation is guaranteed
