## TASK #23 - N8N workflow does not contain the removed filters

cumentation and technical checklist as needed
**TITLE**: Remove N8N Filter for isActive and isBlacklisted ‚Äì Move Logic to Backend (LLM/Workflow Bypass)
**DESCRIPTION/ROADMAP**:

- Refactor the backend message processing logic so that:- Centralizes business logic in the backend for better maintainability and security
  - If `customer.isActive === false` **OR** `customer.isBlacklisted === true`, the backend must: or inactive customers
    - NOT call LLM (no OpenRouter, no AI response)
    - NOT call N8N (no workflow trigger)of logic
    - Only save the inbound message to history (using MessageRepository.saveMessage)
    - Return a 200 OK with `processedMessage: ""` and no error
- Remove the corresponding filter/condition from the N8N workflow:
  - Eliminate any N8N node or filter that checks `{{$json.precompiledData.customer.isActive}}` or `{{$json.precompiledData.customer.isBlacklisted}}`checks in the backend only
  - The backend will be the single source of truth for these checks
- Ensure that the logic is now identical to how `activeChatbot` is handled (manual operator mode):
  - If any of these conditions are true, the system is "muted" for AI/automation, but always logs the message
- Add/Update unit and integration tests to verify:
  - No LLM/N8N call is made when customer is inactive or blacklisted
  - Messages are always saved to history
  - N8N workflow does not contain the removed filters========================================
- Update documentation and technical checklist as needed
  (manual operator mode), the message is always saved to the chat history, just like AI/LLM responses. This guarantees full auditability and traceability of all operator actions (operator/manual mode logic).
  **RATIONALE**:- [ ] On the FAQ page (/faq), if there are 10 or fewer elements, the pagination controls should not be visible. Only show pagination if there are more than 10 items. (FAQ page pagination logic)
  he 'Add Categories' button to just 'Add' for consistency across all CRUD pages (button text standardization)
- Centralizes business logic in the backend for better maintainability and security- [ ] On the Offers page (/offers), if there are fewer than 10 elements, the pagination controls should not be visible. Only show pagination if there are more than 10 items. (Offers page pagination logic)
- Prevents accidental AI/automation triggers for blocked or inactive customers
- Ensures message history is always complete, regardless of customer status
- Simplifies N8N workflow and reduces duplication of logic
  ion
  **SPECIAL NOTE**:**DESCRIPTION/ROADMAP**:

- This task will remove the filter logic from N8N and enforce all checks in the backend only- Create a legal notice ('Aviso legal') PDF document.
- Applies to both REST API and WhatsApp/N8N webhook flowstion or appropriate storage).
- Must be coordinated with N8N workflow update to avoid regressions section (e.g., legal, compliance, or info page).

## BUG TASK #24

**TITLE**: Discounted Price Not Applied in LLM/N8N Responses
**DESCRIPTION/ROADMAP**:

- When a customer with a discount (e.g., 10%) asks for a product price, the system returns the full price instead of the discounted price.
- Investigate why the discount is not being applied in the LLM/N8N response flow.
- Ensure the correct discounted price is always shown in responses, both in RAG/LLM and N8N flows.
- Add/Update tests to verify correct discount application in all relevant endpoints and flows.

**SPECIAL NOTE**:
Andrea requires that the customer discount logic is always respected and visible to the user. No hardcoded prices; always use the dynamic, discounted price.

## üìù IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- All tasks follow existing project architecture (DDD backend, React frontend)
- Database changes require Prisma migration scripts
- Frontend changes must maintain existing design system consistency
- All APIs must include proper error handling and validation
- Tests should be added for new functionality
- Andrea's approval required before marking any task as "DONE"

## üß™ TESTING STRATEGY

**CURRENT APPROACH**: Focus on core functionality stability first

- **Unit Tests**: Da implementare quando la situazione sar√† stabile
- **Integration Tests**: Da implementare quando la situazione sar√† stabile
- **Priority**: Prima stabilizzare le funzionalit√† core, poi aggiungere test completi

**FUTURE TESTING PLAN**:

- Comprehensive unit tests for all services and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints and database operations
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Test coverage target: >80% when system is stable
