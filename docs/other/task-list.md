## TASK #27

**TITLE**: Payment Page: Create Order and Handle Shipping Address via Call Function
**DESCRIPTION/ROADMAP**:

- On payment confirmation, trigger a call function to the backend to create a new order record
- Manage the shipping address as part of this call function flow
- Update the call function prompt to include all necessary order and shipping address details
- Ensure the backend correctly saves the order and shipping address
- Test the end-to-end flow from payment to order creation and address storage

**SPECIAL NOTE**:
Andrea requires that the payment page, once payment is confirmed, always triggers a backend call function to create the order and handle the shipping address. The prompt for the call function must be updated to reflect this logic.

**TITLE**: Implement 'Aviso legal' PDF Upload and Integration
**DESCRIPTION/ROADMAP**:

- Create a legal notice ('Aviso legal') PDF document
- Upload the PDF to the system and ensure it is stored correctly (e.g., in the documents section or appropriate storage)
- Integrate the PDF so it is accessible from the relevant section (e.g., legal, compliance, or info page)
- Test the upload and retrieval process to verify PDF/document management works as expected
- Use this as a test case for document/PDF management features

**SPECIAL NOTE**:
Andrea wants to try uploading and managing a legal notice PDF to validate the document handling flow.

## TASK #26

**TITLE**: Automatic Embedding Trigger on Data Change
**DESCRIPTION/ROADMAP**:

- Remove the manual embedding button from all relevant sections (documents, products, FAQs, services, etc.)
- Automatically trigger the embedding process after every add, update, or delete operation
- Ensure this behavior is consistent across all sessions and entity types
- No manual intervention required for embedding generation
- Test thoroughly to confirm embeddings are always up-to-date

**SPECIAL NOTE**:
Andrea requires a clean and maintainable database. All legacy or unused tables must be removed to avoid confusion and improve performance.hat embedding is always up-to-date and automatic. The manual embedding button is no longer desired and must be removed everywhere.

## TASK #23 - N8N workflow does not contain the removed filters

cumentation and technical checklist as needed
**TITLE**: Remove N8N Filter for isActive and isBlacklisted â€“ Move Logic to Backend (LLM/Workflow Bypass)
**DESCRIPTION/ROADMAP**:

- Refactor the backend message processing logic so that:- Centralizes business logic in the backend for better maintainability and security
  - If `customer.isActive === false` **OR** `customer.isBlacklisted === true`, the backend must: or inactive customers
    - NOT call LLM (no OpenRouter, no AI response)
    - NOT call N8N (no workflow trigger)of logic
    - Only save the inbound message to history (using MessageRepository.saveMessage)
    - Return a 200 OK with `processedMessage: ""` and no error
- Remove the corresponding filter/condition from the N8N workflow:
  - Eliminate any N8N node or filter that checks `{{$json.precompiledData.customer.isActive}}` or `{{$json.precompiledData.customer.isBlacklisted}}`checks in the backend only
  - The backend will be the single source of truth for these checks
- Ensure that the logic is now identical to how `activeChatbot` is handled (manual operator mode):
  - If any of these conditions are true, the system is "muted" for AI/automation, but always logs the message
- Add/Update unit and integration tests to verify:
  - No LLM/N8N call is made when customer is inactive or blacklisted
  - Messages are always saved to history
  - N8N workflow does not contain the removed filters========================================
- Update documentation and technical checklist as needed
  (manual operator mode), the message is always saved to the chat history, just like AI/LLM responses. This guarantees full auditability and traceability of all operator actions (operator/manual mode logic).
  **RATIONALE**:- [ ] On the FAQ page (/faq), if there are 10 or fewer elements, the pagination controls should not be visible. Only show pagination if there are more than 10 items. (FAQ page pagination logic)
  he 'Add Categories' button to just 'Add' for consistency across all CRUD pages (button text standardization)
- Centralizes business logic in the backend for better maintainability and security- [ ] On the Offers page (/offers), if there are fewer than 10 elements, the pagination controls should not be visible. Only show pagination if there are more than 10 items. (Offers page pagination logic)
- Prevents accidental AI/automation triggers for blocked or inactive customers
- Ensures message history is always complete, regardless of customer status
- Simplifies N8N workflow and reduces duplication of logic
  ion
  **SPECIAL NOTE**:**DESCRIPTION/ROADMAP**:

- This task will remove the filter logic from N8N and enforce all checks in the backend only- Create a legal notice ('Aviso legal') PDF document.
- Applies to both REST API and WhatsApp/N8N webhook flowstion or appropriate storage).
- Must be coordinated with N8N workflow update to avoid regressions section (e.g., legal, compliance, or info page).
