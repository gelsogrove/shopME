Welcome to ShopMe, a WhatsApp-based e-commerce platform designed to empower businesses with conversational commerce tools. At ShopMe, we take your privacy and data protection seriously.

## 4. Purpose of Data Processing

We collect and process data for the following purposes:

- To provide and maintain the platform and services
- To enable communication via WhatsApp
- To support order management and delivery
- To improve and personalize user experience
- To ensure platform security and prevent abuse

Each data processing activity is based on one of the following legal bases:

- **Performance of a contract** (e.g. order processing)
- **Legitimate interest** (e.g. fraud prevention)
- **Consent** (e.g. marketing notifications)
- **Legal obligation** (e.g. accounting)

---

## 5. Data Protection and Security Measures

We implement strict technical and organizational measures to protect personal data:

- **Pseudonymization** of sensitive data before sending to external AI services (e.g. OpenRouter)
- **End-to-end encryption** (HTTPS and encrypted storage)
- **JWT-based authentication** and role-based access control
- **Rate limiting and abuse detection** mechanisms
- **Audit logs** for all sensitive actions
- **Data retention policies** with automatic expiration where applicable
- **Encrypted backups** and disaster recovery procedures

---

## 6. Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

We use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) through OpenRouter to generate conversational replies. Before sending data to OpenRouter:

- Sensitive fields (name, phone, address) are **replaced with tokens**
- Tokens are **mapped internally and stored temporarily**, never shared externally
- AI responses are **de-tokenized only in our backend** before being sent to users

This ensures that no Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is shared with third-party AI services.

---

## 7. Data Retention

- Chat messages: up to 2 years (configurable by workspace)
- Order data: up to 5 years for legal and financial compliance
- Logs and activity data: up to 1 year
- AI prompt sessions: stored for 30 days (test sessions: 24h max)

Users can request deletion of their data at any time by contacting the business or ShopMe directly.

- Right to access their personal data

- Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")

All subprocessors comply with GDPR and implement appropriate security measures. Data transfers outside the EU are covered by Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or equivalent mechanisms.
