# Updates to PRD

### Out of Scope Features

These features have been determined to be completely out of scope for the current version of the product. Unlike Non-Goals (MVP) which will be implemented in future phases, these features are not planned for implementation in the immediate roadmap.

1. **Order Management System:**
   - Complete order processing and tracking
   - Order status management
   - Invoice generation and management
   - Shipping integration and tracking
   - Returns and refunds processing
   - **Rationale:** After evaluation, we've determined that the full order management system requires significant integration with external systems (payment, shipping, etc.) and complex business logic that would extend beyond our current development capacity. Users can still browse products and interact with the chatbot, but actual order processing will need to be handled through external systems.

2. **Marketing Campaign Management:**
   - Campaign creation and scheduling
   - A/B testing tools
   - Campaign analytics
   - Audience segmentation
   - **Rationale:** Marketing campaign features require complex integration with analytics and user behavior tracking systems that are beyond our current scope.

3. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard:**
   - Real-time analytics
   - Custom report generation
   - Data visualization tools
   - Export capabilities
   - **Rationale:** Advanced analytics require significant data processing and storage capabilities that are not aligned with our current infrastructure plans.
