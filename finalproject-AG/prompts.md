## PROMPT 1:  

This is a metaprompt to generate a complete PRD document for a WhatsApp-based e-commerce platform called "ShopMe". The document should describe the phases of market research, business model definition, technical architecture, feature specification, and go-to-market strategy.

Please generate a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) in markdown format for a WhatsApp-based e-commerce platform following the phases of market research, business model definition, technical architecture, feature specification, and go-to-market strategy.

Nothing has been created yet except the name "ShopMe" so we need to define those key functionalities that will make ShopMe shine above competitors: providing a seamless shopping experience through WhatsApp, secure handling of sensitive operations, cross-industry adaptability, AI-powered conversations, and push notifications that drive engagement and sales.

For all diagrams and tables, use Mermaid syntax when possible or ASCII tables. Maintain a professional tone throughout the document. The document should be detailed, technically accurate, and written in professional business language. Include metrics and KPIs throughout to demonstrate business impact.
