This planned expansion will be developed in future phases after the core e-commerce functionality is successfully implemented and validated in the marketplace.

The platform is designed for any business that offers products or services to clients, from retail stores and service providers to hospitality businesses like hotels, restaurants, gyms, and fitness centers. This versatility allows businesses to not only sell products but also manage appointments, reservations, and memberships through conversational interfaces.

## 2. User Journey

### Administrator Experience

- Access a web dashboard to:
  - Create and manage multiple workspaces.
  - Configure WhatsApp channels (phone numbers, API tokens, webhooks).
  - Customize AI prompts, add products (with photos, text, pricing,offerts), and organize them into service categories.
  - Manage products, services, and clients through intuitive interfaces.

### End User Experience

- Interact exclusively through WhatsApp:
  - **Initial Contact**: New users receive a welcome message introducing the service.
  - **Registration Process**:
    - For unregistered users, the system automatically generates and sends a unique registration link via WhatsApp.
    - The link directs users to a secure web-based registration form.
    - The registration form collects essential information:
      - First Name (required)
      - Last Name (required)
      - Company Name (required)
      - Language preference selection (required) - Default language is detected from user's browser
      - Currency preference selection (required) - Default EUR
      - GDPR consent with full text of the privacy policy displayed for review
      - Push notification consent checkbox with label: "Are you interested to receive offers with push notifications? You will be able to unsubscribe whenever you want" (optional)
      - Submit button to complete registration
    - Upon successful submission, the user is registered in the system and can immediately continue their interaction through WhatsApp.
    - A personalized welcome message is sent in the user's selected language, confirming their registration and explaining data protection measures, including a link to a dedicated page with detailed information about the encryption system used to protect their data.
  - **Returning Users**: Existing users receive a personalized greeting and can request information, place orders, and receive communications.
  - **Continuous Experience**: All subsequent interactions happen seamlessly within WhatsApp, creating a frictionless shopping experience.

## 3. Objectives

### Business Goals

- Significantly reduce client service time through automation.
- Provide 24/7 client support.
- Build client loyalty through future push campaigns (e.g., greetings, promotions, appointment reminders).
- Enable businesses of all types to engage with clients through familiar messaging interfaces.
- Create a versatile platform adaptable to various industries and business models.

### Non-Goals (MVP)

- **Integrated Payment System and Workable Payment Plan:**

  - This combines the original "Implement an integrated payment system" and "Usage and a workable plan for payments."
  - It's crucial to state that _both_ the _implementation_ and a _detailed plan_ are out of scope for the MVP.
  - **Rationale:** Even a high-level plan has design implications. If you defer _all_ payment considerations, you risk architectural issues later. However, in the MVP, the _actual integration_ and _full payment flow_ are not required.

- **Usage Statistics and Analytics:**

  - This is clearer than just "Usage" and separates it from other concerns.
  - **Rationale:** Gathering and displaying detailed analytics can be complex. The MVP should focus on core functionality.

- **Push Campaigns and Marketing Automation:**

  - This is more specific than just "Push campaigns."
  - **Rationale:** Marketing automation features are often added later to enhance user engagement.

- **Advanced Authentication and Security:**

  - This groups related security features.
  - Includes:
    - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication (if you're using a simpler auth for MVP)
    - 2FA authentication (Two-Factor Authentication)
    - "Forgot Password" functionality
    - "Create User" (if you're handling user creation in a very basic way for MVP)
  - **Rationale:** While basic security is essential, more complex auth can be deferred.

- **Scalability and Monitoring Infrastructure:**

  - This is more specific than just "scale and monitor the system."
  - **Rationale:** While you need to _design_ for scalability, the _full infrastructure_ and monitoring setup can be iterative.
    - For MVP, you might handle scaling manually or with basic tools.
    - Detailed performance monitoring and automated scaling can come later.

- **Comprehensive GDPR Compliance Implementation:**

  - This is carefully worded. You **must** _consider_ GDPR from the start, but the _full and polished implementation_ can be phased.
  - **Rationale:**

    - You can't ignore privacy. Design must be privacy-preserving.
    - However, features like detailed consent management, data portability exports, and full audit logs can be developed iteratively.
    - The _core_ principles (data minimization, security) _must_ be in place.

- **Product Image Upload to S3/Cloud Storage:**

  - Integration with cloud storage services for product image upload and management.
  - **Rationale:** While product image management is important, the MVP can use simpler approaches like URL references to existing images. Full integration with S3 or similar cloud storage services will be implemented in future versions.

  - development environments and monitoring infrastructure can be phased.
  - Product offerts

### Out of Scope Features

These features have been determined to be completely out of scope for the current version of the product. Unlike Non-Goals (MVP) which will be implemented in future phases, these features are not planned for implementation in the immediate roadmap.

1. **Order Management System:**

   - Complete order processing and tracking
   - Order status management
   - Invoice generation and management
   - Shipping integration and tracking
   - Returns and refunds processing
   - **Rationale:** After evaluation, we've determined that the full order management system requires significant integration with external systems (payment, shipping, etc.) and complex business logic that would extend beyond our current development capacity. Users can still browse products and interact with the chatbot, but actual order processing will need to be handled through external systems.

2. **Marketing Campaign Management:**

   - Campaign creation and scheduling
   - A/B testing tools
   - Campaign analytics
   - Audience segmentation
   - **Rationale:** Marketing campaign features require complex integration with analytics and user behavior tracking systems that are beyond our current scope.

3. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard:**
   - Real-time analytics
   - Custom report generation
   - Data visualization tools
   - Export capabilities
   - **Rationale:** Advanced analytics require significant data processing and storage capabilities that are not aligned with our current infrastructure plans.

## 4. Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: React (latest version) with shadcn/ui library and Tailwind CSS to accelerate development.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Domain Driven Design (DDD) pattern.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL.
- **SaaS Architecture**: Multi-tenant design with complete data isolation betwee in man workspaces.
- **AI Service**: OpenRouter (RAG) with data pseudonymization.
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Official Meta API.

### OpenRouter Integration and Data Flow

The system uses OpenRouter's Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities to power the AI-assisted interactions within the platform. Here's how the data flows:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Customer as Customer
    participant WhatsApp as WhatsApp
    participant API as ShopMe API
    participant AI as OpenRouter AI
    participant DB as Database

    Customer->>WhatsApp: Sends message
    WhatsApp->>API: Forwards message via webhook
    API->>DB: Checks client context & history
    API->>API: Tokenizes personal data
    API->>AI: Sends tokenized data for processing
    AI->>API: Returns AI response
    API->>API: De-tokenizes response
    API->>WhatsApp: Forwards response
    WhatsApp->>Customer: Delivers response
```

1. **Data Collection**: When a WhatsApp message is received from a client, it arrives through the Meta API.

2. **Pre-processing**: The backend identifies any personal or sensitive information in the incoming message.

3. **Pseudonymization**: Before sending data to OpenRouter, all personal identifiers are replaced with tokens (see Security section on Pseudonymization for details).

4. **AI Processing**: The tokenized data is sent to OpenRouter, which generates contextually appropriate responses based on the prompt templates and product information.

5. **Post-processing**: The backend replaces any tokens in the AI response with the actual personal data before sending the response back to the client.

6. **Response Delivery**: The final processed response is sent to the client via the WhatsApp API.

This architecture ensures that no personally identifiable information (PII) is exposed to external AI services while maintaining the conversational quality and personalization of responses.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- Fully operational CRUD functionality for workspaces, products, prompts, services, languages, and users.
- Chatbot responses generated within seconds.
- API communication protected via JWT tokens.
- Intuitive dashboard with 2FA authentication.
- Anti-abuse protection system that automatically blocks users sending more than 8 messages per minute.
- Manual blocking functionality allowing administrators to block specific users directly from the chat interface when necessary.

### Anti-Abuse System

To prevent system abuse and ensure fair resource allocation, the platform implements an automated rate-limiting mechanism:

- If a user sends more than 8 messages within a 60-second window, their profile status is automatically changed to "blocked"
- The system responds with a message: "Your number has been blocked due to improper use. Please contact the administrator to unblock it."
- Administrators can view blocked users in the dashboard and manually unblock legitimate users
- The system maintains logs of blocking events for security analysis

Additionally, administrators can manually block problematic users directly from the chat interface:

- A block button in the chat header allows for immediate blocking of the current user
- When manually blocked, users receive notification about their blocked status
- Administrators can view and manage all blocked users from a centralized section in the dashboard
- Block/unblock actions are logged for audit purposes

This dual approach (automatic and manual blocking) protects against spam attacks, prevents AI resource waste, and ensures a smooth experience for all legitimate users. Rate limits and blocking policies are configurable by workspace administrators to accommodate different business needs and usage patterns.

## 6.5 WhatsApp Messaging Flow API

The platform implements a comprehensive messaging flow through the `MessageProcessorAPI` that handles all WhatsApp communications. This API serves as the core middleware between incoming WhatsApp messages and AI-powered responses.

### 6.5.1 Flow Architecture

The messaging flow follows this sequence:

1. **Reception**: Incoming messages from WhatsApp are received via webhook
2. **Challenge Verification**: System checks if the workspace is active
3. **User Identification**: System identifies the user and checks if they're new or existing
4. **Agent Selection**: For existing users, the appropriate specialized agent is selected based on message context
5. **Context Loading**: User data, order history, and previous messages are retrieved
6. **Data Protection**: Personal data is tokenized before processing
7. **AI Processing**: The tokenized message is processed by OpenRouter AI
8. **Response Formatting**: AI response is made conversational
9. **Data Restoration**: Tokens are replaced with actual user data
10. **History Tracking**: The exchange is logged in the chat history
11. **Delivery**: The response is sent back to the user via WhatsApp

### 6.5.2 Implementation

The API is implemented through the following core function:

```javascript
try {
  // Check if challenge is active
  if (!isChallengeActive()) {
    inactiveMessage = getInactiveMessage()
    sendMessage(inactiveMessage)
    return
  }

  let systemResp
  const message = GetQuestion()
  const userID = GetUserId()
  const userInfo = getUserData(userID)
  const isNewUser = isPresent(userInfo) ? false : true

  if (isNewUser) {
    // New link to the registration form
    return "LINK"
  } else {
    // 0. GET DATA
    routerAgent = getRouterAgent()
    const agentSelected = GetAgentDedicatedFromRouterAgent(routerAgent, message)
    const prompt = loadPrompt(agentSelected)
    const orders = getOrders()
    const products = getProducts()
    const historyMessages = GetHistory("last 30 messages")

    // 1. TOKENIZE (ora restituisce anche la mappa)
    const { fakeMessage, fakeUserInfo, tokenMap } = Tokenize(message, userInfo)

    // 2. OPENROUTER
    systemResp = getResponse(
      prompt,
      agentSelected,
      historyMessages,
      fakeMessage,
      fakeUserInfo,
      orders,
      products
    )
    // Attach a calling function when we have the order details
    // Attach a calling function when we have to send the invoices

    // 4. CONVERSIONAL RESPONSE
    systemResp = conversationalResponse(
      "metti la frase in maniera discorsiva:" + systemResp
    )

    // 5. DETOKENIZE
    const resp = Detokenize(systemResp, systemResp)

    // 6. SAVE TO HISTORY
    saveToChatHistory(userID, agentSelected, message, resp)

    return resp
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Errore in main:", error)
}
```

### 6.5.3 Database Requirements

To support this messaging flow, the database includes the following key entities:

- **ChatSession**: Tracks ongoing conversations with metadata
- **Message**: Stores individual messages with direction, content, and status
- **Prompts**: Stores AI agent configurations and prompts
- **Customers**: Contains user data and preferences

These models support the conversational interface shown in the platform's chat interface:

![Chat Interface](https://path-to-chat-interface-image.png)

The interface provides:

- List of recent conversations on the left panel
- Detailed conversation view on the right panel
- Real-time message exchange with timestamps
- Order tracking and status information
- Clear visual distinction between incoming and outgoing messages

## 7. Database Model

## 8. Backend Architecture and Implementation

### Overview

The backend system of this PDR application will be developed using Node.js with the Express.js framework, adopting the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architectural pattern and implemented as a monorepo using Turborepo. This architecture allows for efficient code organization, shared dependencies, and optimized builds across multiple packages.

The monorepo structure, powered by Turborepo, provides several key benefits:

- Centralized code management with shared configurations
- Optimized build pipeline with intelligent caching
- Consistent development experience across packages
- Efficient dependency management
- Standardized tooling and processes

### Key Features

#### Multilingual Welcome Messages

The system supports configurable welcome messages in multiple languages:

- **Languages**: Italian (IT), English (EN), and Spanish (ES)
- **Storage**: Welcome messages are stored in the Workspace settings as JSON data
- **Configuration**: Admin users can customize welcome messages for each language through the Settings interface
- **Usage**: The appropriate language version is automatically selected based on:
  - User's explicit language preference (if set)
  - Initial greeting language detection (Hola → Spanish, Hello → English, Ciao → Italian)
  - Workspace default language (fallback)
- **Format**: Messages can include emojis and formatting for a friendly, engaging experience

This feature ensures users receive culturally appropriate greetings that establish the right tone for the conversation from the very beginning, enhancing the personalization of the customer experience.

### Docker Architecture

The ShopMe platform utilizes a simplified containerized architecture with Docker to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments. The system is built with a minimalist approach, focusing only on essential containers:

#### Container Architecture

- **PostgreSQL Container**:

  - Image: PostgreSQL 14
  - Purpose: Primary database storing all application data
  - Ports: 5432
  - Volumes: Database data, periodic backups
  - Configuration: Optimized for performance with appropriate memory allocation and connection pooling

 

#### Deployment Strategy

This streamlined two-container approach is consistent across both local development and production environments:

**Local Development:**

- Docker Compose orchestrates both containers

- Local volume mounts for easy development and debugging
- Environment variables managed through .env files (not committed to version control)

**Production (Heroku):**

- Both containers deployed using Heroku container registry
- PostgreSQL configured with Heroku PostgreSQL add-on for managed database service
- Environment variables managed through Heroku config vars
- Automated backups configured for both containers

This minimalist container strategy reduces operational complexity while providing all necessary functionality for the application. The frontend and API are deployed using Heroku's standard buildpacks rather than containers, further simplifying the architecture.

This architecture will ensure a robust, secure, and scalable backend system, in line with the digitization and resilience objectives of the PDR.

### User Preferences Management and Account Deletion

To ensure full control over their data and comply with GDPR requirements, the platform provides users with comprehensive self-service options for managing their account:

#### 1. User Preferences Management

- **Access Method**: Users can request a preferences management link through WhatsApp with the command "update my preferences"
- **Security**: The link contains a secure, time-limited token valid for 24 hours
- **Editable Information**:
  - Personal details (name, company)
  - Language preference
  - Currency preference
  - Push notification settings
  - Communication preferences
- **Process Flow**:
  1. User requests preferences update link via WhatsApp
  2. System generates a secure token and creates a unique URL
  3. URL is sent to user via WhatsApp
  4. User accesses the web interface with pre-filled current settings
  5. User makes desired changes and submits the form
  6. System updates the profile and confirms changes
  7. User receives confirmation message via WhatsApp

#### 2. Account Deletion Process

- **Access Method**: Within the preferences management page, users have access to an "Delete My Account" option
- **Confirmation Process**:
  - Users must type their phone number to confirm deletion
  - A clear warning about the permanent nature of deletion is shown
  - Two-step verification with a WhatsApp confirmation message
- **Data Handling**:
  - **Deleted Immediately**:
    - Personal identifying information (name, email, contact details)
    - Chat history and conversation logs
    - Preferences and consent records
  - **Preserved Data**:
    - Order records (anonymized with a reference ID)
    - Transaction history (required for legal and financial records)
    - Aggregate usage statistics (fully anonymized)
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - User record is not physically deleted but pseudonymized
  - Name is replaced with "Deleted User"
  - Contact information is nullified
  - A deletion timestamp is recorded
  - Associated chat history is physically deleted
- **Confirmation**:
  - User receives final confirmation of account deletion
  - Instructions for data recovery during grace period (30 days)
  - Contact information for any questions about remaining data

#### 3. API Endpoints

- `GET /api/clients/preferences/:token`
  - **Description**: Retrieves user preferences for editing using a secure token
  - **Returns**: Current user preferences and profile information

- `PUT /api/clients/preferences/:token`
  - **Description**: Updates user preferences
  - **Body**: Modified user preferences
  - **Returns**: Confirmation of updates applied

- `POST /api/clients/deletion-request/:token`
  - **Description**: Initiates account deletion process
  - **Body**: `phone_confirmation` (user's phone for verification)
  - **Returns**: Confirmation and next steps for two-factor verification

- `POST /api/clients/confirm-deletion`
  - **Description**: Completes account deletion after two-factor verification
  - **Body**: `verification_code` sent via WhatsApp
  - **Returns**: Final confirmation of account deletion

This comprehensive approach ensures users maintain control over their data while the platform preserves necessary information for legal and business continuity purposes.

## Multi-Tenant Architecture Implementation

The ShopMe platform follows a strict multi-tenant architecture where each client business operates within its own isolated workspace. This architectural approach ensures data isolation, security, and scalability.

### Workspace-Based Data Isolation

1. **Database Implementation**:

   - Every major entity in the database includes a `workspace_id` foreign key reference
   - Database constraints enforce that entities can only be associated with a single workspace
   - Queries are always scoped to a specific workspace_id to prevent data leakage between tenants
   - Database triggers enforce workspace data isolation on insert/update operations

2. **API Request Filtering**:

   - All API endpoints (except authentication) require a workspace context
   - Workspace identification is handled through:
     - Explicit `workspace_id` parameter for GET requests
     - `workspace_id` field in request bodies for POST/PUT requests
     - JWT token payload containing workspace context for authenticated requests
   - API middleware automatically applies workspace filtering to all database queries
   - Attempts to access data across workspaces are blocked with 403 Forbidden responses

3. **User-Workspace Relationship**:
   - Users can be associated with multiple workspaces through the `user_workspaces` junction table
   - Each user-workspace association has a specific role (admin, manager, agent, etc.)
   - Session management includes the active workspace context
   - Workspace switching requires explicit user action and re-establishing session context

### Security Measures for Tenant Isolation

1. **Query Layer Security**:

   - ORM/Repository layer implements workspace filtering as non-bypassable middleware
   - Raw SQL queries are prohibited; all database access goes through workspace-aware repositories
   - Workspace validation occurs at controller, service, and repository levels (defense in depth)

2. **Resource Allocation**:

   - Each workspace has configurable resource limits (API rate limits, storage quotas, etc.)
   - Resource monitoring tracks usage per workspace
   - Tenant isolation prevents resource consumption by one tenant from affecting others

3. **Data Export/Import**:
   - Data export functions include workspace validation
   - Bulk operations maintain workspace context for all affected records
   - ETL processes enforce workspace boundaries

The multi-tenant architecture ensures that:

- Each client's data remains completely isolated from other clients
- API requests are always scoped to the requesting client's workspace
- Database operations maintain tenant boundaries at all times
- Users with access to multiple workspaces can only operate within one workspace context at a time

This approach enables the system to securely serve multiple businesses while maintaining strict data separation and optimizing resource utilization.

### Security

#### Authentication and Authorization

The system implements a secure authentication mechanism using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) stored in HTTP-only cookies:

1. **JWT-based Authentication**:
   - Tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies to prevent JavaScript access
   - Tokens are secure, with appropriate expiration times
   - CSRF protection is implemented
   - Fallback to Authorization headers for backward compatibility

2. **Login Process**:
   - User submits credentials (email/password)
   - System validates credentials against the database
   - Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is generated and stored in an HTTP-only cookie
   - User information is returned to the frontend (without the token)

3. **Authentication Middleware**:
   - Checks for token in cookies first, then falls back to Authorization header
   - Verifies token validity and signature
   - Attaches user context to the request for downstream use
   - Handles authentication errors appropriately

4. **Logout Process**:
   - Clears the HTTP-only cookie on the server
   - Removes user data from local storage on the client
   - Redirects to login page

5. **Access Control**:
   - Role-based authorization (Admin, Owner, Standard User)
   - Workspace-specific permissions
   - Resource-level access controls

The token payload contains the user's ID, email, and role, allowing for proper authorization checks across the application.

### WhatsApp Settings Management

- `GET /api/whatsapp-settings/:workspaceId/gdpr`

  - **Description**: Retrieves the GDPR policy content for a workspace
  - **Parameters**: `workspaceId` (required): Workspace identifier
  - **Returns**: GDPR policy text

- `PUT /api/whatsapp-settings/:workspaceId/gdpr`

  - **Description**: Updates the GDPR policy content for a workspace
  - **Parameters**: `workspaceId` (required): Workspace identifier
  - **Body**: `gdpr` (required): GDPR policy text
  - **Returns**: Updated WhatsApp settings

- `GET /api/gdpr/default`

  - **Description**: Retrieves the default GDPR policy text template
  - **Returns**: Default GDPR policy content

## 5. User Interface

### 5.1 Dashboard Layout

The dashboard follows a modern, clean design with an emphasis on usability and efficiency:

- **Navigation**: Left sidebar with clear category icons
- **Content Area**: Center-aligned with responsive design
- **Controls**: Positioned consistently at the top of content sections
- **Data Display**: Organized in tables and cards with consistent spacing

### 5.2 Color Schema

The application follows a consistent color scheme to maintain brand identity:

- **Primary**: Green (#10b981) - Used for primary actions, buttons, and key UI elements
- **Secondary**: Gray (#6b7280) - Used for secondary elements, text, and borders
- **Accent**: Blue (#3b82f6) - Used sparingly for highlighting important information
- **Neutral**: White (#f9fafb) - Used for backgrounds and spacing
- **Error**: Red (#ef4444) - Used for errors, alerts, and destructive actions
- **Warning**: Yellow (#f59e0b) - Used for warnings and caution notifications
- **Success**: Green (#10b981) - Used for success messages and confirmations

### 5.3 Notification Badges

The application implements a notification badge system in the sidebar navigation to alert users about pending actions and items requiring attention:

#### Chat History Badge

- **Purpose**: Displays the total count of unread messages across all chat conversations
- **Visual Appearance**: A small red circular badge containing a white number
- **Behavior**:
  - Initially shows a count of 2 unread messages when the application loads
  - Updates in real-time when new messages arrive
  - When a user opens a chat, the associated messages are marked as read
  - The badge count decreases as messages are read
  - The badge disappears completely when all messages are read (count equals zero)
  - After reading all messages, the Chat History icon remains without a badge until new unread messages arrive

#### Clients Badge

- **Purpose**: Indicates the number of unknown customers who require identification or profile completion
- **Visual Appearance**: Similar red circular badge with white number
- **Behavior**:
  - Shows a consistent count of 2 unknown clients by default
  - Represents customers who have contacted the business but haven't been properly profiled
  - When administrators properly identify and categorize these clients, the badge count should update
  - Serves as a reminder to maintain clean and complete customer records

#### Implementation Details

- Badge counts are stored in component state variables and updated through API calls
- The system updates badge counts in these scenarios:
  - On initial page load
  - When a user reads messages
  - When a new message arrives (via polling or websocket)
  - When customer profiles are updated
- The badge visual style is consistent across the application:
  - Size: Compact (16-20px diameter)
  - Position: Upper right corner of the associated navigation item
  - Color: Red background (#ef4444) with white text
  - Animation: Subtle entrance animation when count changes

This notification system improves workflow efficiency by providing visual cues for pending actions, helping administrators prioritize their tasks and ensure timely responses to customers.

### Data Protection and Encryption System

To ensure the highest level of data protection and privacy for users, the platform implements a comprehensive tokenization and encryption system:

#### 1. Tokenization System

- **Personal Data Protection**: The system automatically tokenizes all personally identifiable information (PII) before processing messages with any AI model.
- **How It Works**: When a user sends a message, their personal data (name, phone number, address, etc.) is replaced with random tokens before being sent to the AI for processing.
- **Real-time De-tokenization**: After receiving the AI response, the system automatically replaces tokens with the original data before sending the message back to the user.

#### 2. Dedicated Information Page

- A dedicated informational page explains the encryption and tokenization process in detail.
- The page includes:
  - Visual representation of how data is protected
  - Technical explanation of the tokenization process
  - Information about data storage security measures
  - Compliance with GDPR and other privacy regulations
  - FAQ about data protection

#### 3. Post-Registration Communication

- After successful registration, users receive an automatic welcome message in their selected language that:
  - Welcomes them by name
  - Confirms their successful registration
  - Explains briefly that their data is protected through tokenization
  - Includes a link to the detailed data protection information page
  - Encourages them to continue the conversation

This approach ensures users are well-informed about data protection measures while building trust in the platform's security practices.
