# ShopMe Frontend - Detailed Section Description

## Authentication

When a user accesses the application, they are greeted by the **login page** where they can enter their credentials. This page features a simple yet robust form that verifies the authenticity of credentials and handles any errors clearly. Once authenticated, the user is guided to the **workspace selection page**, where they can choose among the various work environments they have access to. This functionality is particularly useful for users who manage multiple stores or separate businesses on the platform. The selection is stored in the session, allowing for fluid navigation within the chosen workspace.

## Dashboard and Chat History

The heart of the application is the **Chat History**, which also serves as the main page after login. Here, users can view all WhatsApp conversations with customers, intuitively organized with the chat list on the left and messages from the selected chat on the right. The interface allows users to easily search through conversations and filter messages by specific customer. The input area for responding is positioned at the bottom, simulating the familiar experience of messaging apps. Special emphasis is placed on messages generated by AI, which are highlighted to distinguish them from manual responses. The old **Dashboard** page now automatically redirects to Chat History, simplifying the navigation flow.

## Product Management

The **Products** section allows administrators to efficiently manage the entire catalog. Products are presented in a feature-rich table, with the ability to filter by category and status, as well as quick search by name. For each product, it's possible to view and modify details such as price, availability, and images (currently implemented with placeholders). **Categories** management is accessible both from the products section and from a dedicated page, where users can organize the catalog into logical groups, facilitating navigation by WhatsApp customers.

## Customer and Order Management

The **Clients** section offers a comprehensive overview of all WhatsApp contacts who have interacted with the business. For each client, it's possible to view contact information, order history, and directly access the chat. Administrators can add specific notes and manage personalized preferences for each customer. The **Orders** page presents the complete transaction history, with a filter system for status (pending, confirmed, shipped, delivered) and a detailed view that includes products, quantities, and prices. From here, it's also possible to download invoices (functionality currently simulated) and follow the timeline of the order status.

## Content Management

This section includes various features to manage the customer experience content. The **Services** page allows users to create and modify the services offered, to which various products can be associated. The **Prompts** section is particularly innovative, allowing management of response templates for the AI that assists customers on WhatsApp. Administrators can create specific prompts associated with certain phone numbers, thus customizing the customer experience. Finally, the **Offers** page allows creating targeted promotional campaigns, selecting specific products and scheduling the sending of messages to defined customer segments.

## Settings

The **General Settings** serve as a central hub for workspace configuration, where it's possible to set WhatsApp API parameters, webhooks, operating hours, and automatic messages. This control panel is complemented by specialized sections: **Channel Types** allow configuration of the various messaging platforms supported beyond WhatsApp, while the **Languages** section enables management of languages available for the interface and communications with customers. Finally, **User** management offers tools to administer team accounts, assigning specific roles and permissions to ensure the appropriate level of access for each member.

## Components and Architecture

At the architectural level, the application is built around a system of highly reusable components. The **Layout** defines the general structure with a sidebar for navigation and a header showing information about the user and active workspace. The **UI Components** represent the basic building blocks of the interface, implemented with shadcn/ui and customized according to the application's needs. **Shared Components** like DataTable and FormDialog are used consistently throughout the application, ensuring a coherent user experience and reducing code duplication.

Regarding cross-cutting functionalities, **Routing** is centrally managed in App.tsx, with route protection for unauthenticated users and a nested structure that reflects the logical organization of the application. **State Management** primarily uses React hooks for local state and Context API for global state, adopting a pragmatic approach that favors stateless components where possible. Finally, the visual interface is based on **TailwindCSS** for styling, with a coherent design system that supports light/dark themes and adapts to different screen sizes thanks to a mobile-first approach.
