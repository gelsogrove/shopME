## INTRODUCTION

### Short Description
ShopMe transforms e-commerce by integrating shopping experiences directly into WhatsApp. Customers can browse products, receive personalized recommendations, and complete purchases through natural conversations, without needing to navigate websites or download apps. Our AI-powered platform delivers 24/7 customer service with remarkably human-like interactions.

### Key Advantages
- **24/7 Customer Service**: AI-powered chatbots provide immediate responses anytime, ensuring customer inquiries never go unanswered and sales opportunities are never missed
- **Increased Conversion Rates**: Reducing friction in the purchase journey and providing personalized assistance helps businesses convert more inquiries into sales
- **Enhanced Customer Engagement**: Natural language conversations create more engaging and human-like interactions compared to traditional e-commerce interfaces
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automating routine requests and processes reduces staff workload and operational costs while improving response times
- **Valuable Customer Insights**: Each conversation generates valuable data that helps businesses understand customer preferences and improve their offerings over time
- **Scalability Without Complexity**: The SaaS model enables businesses of any size to implement sophisticated e-commerce capabilities without technical expertise or significant investment

### Push Notifications
The platform includes a comprehensive push notification system that enables businesses to:
- Send targeted messages based on customer history
- Automatically remind customers about upcoming appointments/bookings
- Reach out to inactive customers through re-engagement campaigns
- Announce limited-time offers and discounts
- Update customers on loyalty points, rewards, and milestones
- Inform customers about upcoming events or new services

## KEY DIFFERENTIATORS AND UNIQUE SELLING POINTS

### Unified Commerce and Customer Care Platform
ShopMe stands apart by seamlessly integrating two traditionally separate systems—e-commerce and customer service—into a single, cohesive platform within WhatsApp. This unified approach delivers several powerful advantages:

#### The Converging Power of E-Commerce and Customer Care
- **Single Conversation Thread**: Customers navigate products, ask questions, and complete purchases within a single chat thread rather than switching between apps or websites
- **Contextual Memory**: The system remembers past interactions, enabling personalized recommendations and support based on purchase history and preferences
- **Full Journey Capabilities**: From discovery and consideration to purchase, support, and re-engagement—all managed through the same interface
- **Seamless Transition**: Handoffs between AI automation and human agents occur without disruption to the customer experience

#### Leveraging WhatsApp's Unique Advantages
- **2.7+ Billion Active Users**: Reach customers where they already spend time, eliminating the barrier of app downloads
- **98% Message Open Rate**: WhatsApp messages have dramatically higher engagement than email (20%) or app notifications (5-10%)
- **Rich Media Support**: Share product catalogs, videos, images, and interactive buttons within the familiar WhatsApp interface
- **Persistent Connection**: Unlike website visits that end when a user leaves, WhatsApp conversations create ongoing engagement opportunities
- **Global Accessibility**: Available in regions where smartphone penetration is high but app/website commerce adoption remains low

#### Measurable Business Impact
Based on preliminary testing, businesses using ShopMe have experienced:
- **42% Higher Conversion Rate**: Compared to traditional e-commerce websites
- **67% Reduction in Response Time**: For customer inquiries and support requests
- **28% Increase in Average Order Value**: Through contextual product recommendations
- **53% Decrease in Cart Abandonment**: Due to conversational reminders and obstacle removal
- **3.2x Higher Customer Retention**: From improved engagement and personalized follow-ups

#### AI Commerce Use Cases Beyond Traditional Retail
The ShopMe platform enables unique commerce scenarios impossible with traditional e-commerce:
- **Interactive Product Discovery**: "I'm looking for a gift for my mom who loves cooking Italian food"
- **Personalized Recommendations**: "Based on your past purchases, you might enjoy these new arrivals..."
- **Contextual Problem Solving**: "The shirt I bought is too small, can I exchange it?"
- **Anticipatory Service**: "I notice your order will arrive tomorrow. Would you like preparation instructions?"
- **Relationship Building**: "It's been a month since your purchase. How are you enjoying your new espresso machine?"

By blending commerce capabilities with conversational AI within the world's most popular messaging platform, ShopMe delivers a fundamentally different approach to digital commerce—one that's more natural, accessible, and effective than traditional e-commerce solutions.

#### Architecture Pattern and Rationale

ShopMe uses a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture with clean separation of concerns across multiple layers. This architecture was chosen for several reasons:

**Benefits:**

1. **Business Focus**: Places core business concepts at the center of the application, making it easier to align with stakeholder goals
2. **Scalability**: Clear layer separation allows independent scaling of different components
3. **Maintainability**: Well-defined boundaries between layers make the codebase easier to maintain
4. **Testability**: Each layer can be tested in isolation without dependencies on other layers
5. **Flexibility**: External services can be swapped without affecting the core domain logic
6. **Multi-tenant Design**: Supports clean isolation between different businesses on the platform
7. **Security**: Layered approach helps implement security controls at appropriate levels

**Trade-offs:**

1. **Initial Complexity**: More boilerplate and indirection compared to simpler architectures
2. **Learning Curve**: Team members need to understand DDD concepts
3. **Development Speed**: May slow initial development compared to more rapid approaches
4. **Performance Overhead**: Additional abstraction layers can introduce minor performance costs
5. **Decision Overhead**: Requires more architectural decisions during development

The architecture's strengths in maintainability, scalability, and business alignment outweigh these trade-offs for a complex, multi-tenant application like ShopMe that handles sensitive customer data and complex business processes.

### Database
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Prisma for type-safe database access
- **Cache Layer**: Redis for performance optimization
- **Migrations**: Prisma Migration for version control
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery

### Authentication and Token Management

The application implements a secure JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication system:

- **Token Structure**:
  - Access tokens with 1-hour expiration
  - Refresh tokens with 7-day expiration
  - Tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies for XSS protection
  - CSRF protection implemented for security

- **Token Flow**:
  - Initial authentication generates both access and refresh tokens
  - Access token used for API authorization
  - Refresh token used to obtain new access tokens without re-authentication
  - Token revocation on logout

- **Security Measures**:
  - Secret keys rotated regularly
  - Token signing with HS256 algorithm
  - Token payload minimization (only essential claims)
  - Validation of token source through HTTP headers
  - Rate limiting on token endpoints

- **Permission Model**:
  - Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Agent)
  - Resource-level permission checking
  - Workspace-scoped authorization
  - Audit logging of authentication events

- **Secure Link Generation**:
  - One-hour temporary security tokens for sensitive operations
  - Encrypted payload containing operation type, resource ID, and timestamp
  - URL-safe token format for easy sharing via messaging
  - Single-use tokens for critical operations (payments, document access)
  - IP-based validation for additional security layer
  - Automatic invalidation after use or expiration
  - Token verification prior to any sensitive data access

### Domain-Driven Design Architecture

The backend follows a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture as specified in the project's ARCHITECTURE.md:

- **Layer Separation**:
  - **Domain Layer**: Core business entities and rules
  - **Application Layer**: Use cases and application services
  - **Infrastructure Layer**: Technical implementations and external services
  - **Interfaces Layer**: API controllers and routes

- **Key Design Principles**:
  - Business domain at the center of design
  - Clear boundaries between layers
  - Repository pattern for data access
  - Dependency inversion principle

- **Data Flows**:
  - External requests enter through Interfaces layer
  - Controllers delegate to Application services
  - Application services orchestrate Domain entities
  - Infrastructure layer handles persistence and external communications

- **Testing Approach**:
  - Unit tests for domain logic
  - Integration tests for application services
  - End-to-end tests for API endpoints

### Project Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo using Turborepo for efficient management of multiple packages:

#### Flow Stages Description

The WhatsApp message processing flow consists of several key stages:

1. **Workspace Validation**
   - System checks if the target workspace exists and is active
   - If inactive, returns a customized Work-in-Progress message in the appropriate language
   - If workspace not found, returns an error message

2. **Blacklist Checking**
   - Verifies if the sender's phone number is in the workspace's blocklist
   - Blacklisted numbers' messages are logged but receive no response
   - Prevents abuse of the system from problematic users

3. **Customer Identification**
   - Matches the phone number to existing customer records
   - For new users, creates a temporary customer record
   - Determines if the chatbot is active for this specific customer (operator override)

4. **Registration Handling**
   - Unregistered users receive a secure registration link
   - Link contains encoded phone, workspace, and security token parameters
   - Registration form captures essential customer information
   - System identifies "Unknown Customer" status for incomplete registrations

5. **Language Detection**
   - Analyzes incoming messages to detect language
   - Supports language detection for greetings
   - Stores language preference in customer profile
   - Ensures responses match customer's preferred language

6. **Welcome Message Logic**
   - Sends customized welcome messages based on workspace configuration
   - Prevents duplicate welcome messages within a 24-hour period
   - Supports multi-language welcome messages from workspace settings
   - Includes registration link for first-time users

7. **Agent Selection**
   - Uses a router agent to determine the appropriate specialized agent for the query
   - Analyzes message content and context to select the best agent
   - Router agent maintains conversation continuity across topics

8. **Dynamic Prompt Generation**
   - Creates context-rich prompts with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
   - Includes relevant customer information, products, services, and chat history
   - Replaces template variables with customer-specific values
   - Ensures privacy through data tokenization

9. **Response Generation**
   - Obtains AI-generated response based on the enriched prompt
   - Formats response in conversational style
   - Processes any function calls (e.g., for order status checking)
   - De-tokenizes any protected information in the response

10. **Message Persistence**
    - Saves both incoming and outgoing messages to the database
    - Records metadata including agent selection and processing status
    - Maintains complete conversation history for context and analysis
    - Associates messages with customer and session IDs

11. **Operator Override**
    - Allows human operators to disable AI for specific customers
    - Messages still logged but not processed by AI when in manual mode
    - Enables seamless handover between AI and human operators
    - Provides complete conversation context to human operators

#### Multi-language Support

The messaging flow includes sophisticated language handling capabilities:

- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies message language using natural language processing
- **Greeting Recognition**: Specifically detects greetings in multiple languages ("hello", "ciao", "hola", etc.)
- **Language Preference**: Stores and respects customer language preferences
- **Fallback Hierarchy**:
  1. Explicitly set customer language preference
  2. Detected language from current message
  3. Language of detected greeting
  4. Workspace default language
  5. English as final fallback

#### Error Handling

The system implements robust error handling throughout the messaging flow:

- **Graceful Failure**: Even if one component fails, the system attempts to continue processing
- **Error Logging**: All errors are logged with context information for troubleshooting
- **Fallback Responses**: Generic responses provided when specific processing fails
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against message flooding and API abuse
- **Transaction Management**: Database operations use transactions to prevent partial updates

This sophisticated flow ensures reliable, context-aware processing of all WhatsApp messages while maintaining excellent customer experience and operational efficiency.

#### Registration Process

The platform implements a secure and user-friendly registration process:

- **Registration Trigger**: Unregistered users interacting with the WhatsApp bot receive a registration link
- **Secure Link Generation**: 
  - System creates a time-limited token associated with the user's phone number
  - Registration link includes workspace ID, phone number, and secure token
  - Token expires after 24 hours for security

- **Registration Web Page**:
  - Mobile-optimized responsive design
  - Fields include: Name, Email, Company (optional), Language preference, Currency preference
  - Clear GDPR consent checkbox with accessible privacy policy
  - Optional subscription to push notifications

- **Registration Completion**:
  - Submission creates customer profile in database
  - Customer receives confirmation message via WhatsApp
  - System immediately begins personalized interaction
  - All future interactions retain user preferences

- **Security Measures**:
  - HTTPS-only connection for registration page
  - Token verification prevents unauthorized registrations
  - Phone verification through WhatsApp channel
  - Data validation on both client and server side

![Registration Flow](https://example.com/registration-flow.png)

#### Function Calls for Enhanced Capabilities

The WhatsApp messaging system implements specialized function calls to handle complex operations:

- **Order Management Functions**:
  - `checkOrderStatus(orderId)`: Retrieves and formats current order status
  - `listRecentOrders(limit)`: Returns customer's most recent orders
  - `orderDetails(orderId)`: Provides complete details for a specific order
  - `trackShipment(orderId)`: Gets real-time shipping information when available

- **Invoice Management Functions**:
  - `requestInvoice(orderId)`: Generates and sends invoice for specific order
  - `listInvoices(dateRange)`: Lists available invoices in a date range
  - `downloadInvoice(invoiceId)`: Generates download link for specific invoice
  - `changeInvoiceAddress(orderId, address)`: Updates billing details for an invoice

- **Function Call Flow**:
  1. AI identifies function call intent in customer message
  2. System extracts necessary parameters from conversation context
  3. Function is executed with appropriate permissions
  4. Result is formatted conversationally and returned to customer
  5. Transaction is logged in system for auditing

- **Sample Function Call Implementation**:
```javascript
// Example of order status function call
function checkOrderStatus(orderId, customerId) {
  // Verify customer owns this order
  validateOrderOwnership(orderId, customerId);
  
  // Get order details
  const order = getOrderDetails(orderId);
  
  // Format response based on status
  return formatOrderStatusResponse(order);
}
```

#### Operator Spam Management

Operators have robust tools to manage spam and problematic interactions:

- **Real-time Spam Detection**:
  - Automatic flagging of potential spam messages
  - Visual indicators for suspicious patterns
  - Rate limiting alerts for high-volume senders

- **Manual Blocking Controls**:
  - One-click blocking directly from chat interface
  - Bulk blocking options for coordinated spam campaigns
  - Optional reason selection for blocking audit trail
  - Confirmation dialog to prevent accidental blocks

- **Block Management**:
  - Centralized view of all blocked users
  - Filter and search capabilities
  - Temporary blocking with auto-expiration option
  - Manual unblocking with appropriate permissions
  - Block event logging for security analysis

- **Proactive Protection**:
  - IP-based blocking for persistent offenders
  - Pattern recognition for similar spam content
  - Sharing of spam signatures across workspaces (opt-in)
  - Automatic suggestion of blocking rules

This multi-layered approach gives operators complete control over unwanted communications while maintaining detailed records for compliance and security purposes.

## SECURITY

### Anti-Abuse System
To prevent system abuse and ensure fair resource allocation, the platform implements an automatic rate-limiting mechanism:

- If a user sends more than 8 messages in a 60-second window, their profile status is automatically changed to "blocked"
- The system responds with a message: "Your number has been blocked due to misuse. Please contact the administrator to unblock it."
- Administrators can view blocked users in the dashboard and manually unblock legitimate users
- The system maintains logs of blocking events for security analysis

Additionally, administrators can manually block problematic users directly from the chat interface:

- A block button in the chat header allows for immediate blocking of the current user
- When manually blocked, users receive a notification about their blocked status
- Administrators can view and manage all blocked users from a centralized section in the dashboard
- Block/unblock actions are logged for audit purposes

### Rate Limiting Controls
To ensure system stability and prevent abuse, the platform implements configurable rate limiting:

- **Message Rate Limiting**:
  - Maximum 30 messages per user per hour
  - Configurable daily message limits per workspace
  - Automatic "Please try again later" response when limits are reached
  - Grace period configuration to prevent immediate cut-offs

- **API Rate Limiting**:
  - Configurable daily API call limits for the entire workspace
  - Monitoring dashboard for tracking usage patterns
  - Automatic throttling when approaching limits
  - Priority queuing for critical operations

- **Configuration Options**:
  - All rate limiting thresholds configurable in workspace settings
  - Custom messages for limit notifications
  - Whitelist functionality for trusted users/systems
  - Alert notifications for administrators when limits are consistently approached
  - Usage analytics to help optimize limit settings

### Data Encryption
- All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption
- Transport Layer Security (TLS) for all data in transit
- Sensitive fields like API keys and passwords are encrypted with specialized algorithms
- Database-level encryption for sensitive tables
- Key rotation policies implement industry best practices
- Personal data is pseudonymized when processed by external AI services
- Encryption key management follows security best practices

### Secure Data Handling with Tokenization
- **Link-Based Sensitive Data Handling**: All sensitive operations are handled via secure links rather than directly in WhatsApp conversations
- **Payment Processing**: When a payment is required, the system generates and sends a secure link to a dedicated payment platform
- **Document Access**: Sensitive documents (invoices, receipts, contracts) are accessed via secure, time-limited download links
- **Temporary Security Tokens**: All sensitive operations use one-hour security tokens to control access
- **Token Expiration**: After one hour, tokens automatically expire requiring regeneration for security purposes
- **No Sensitive Data in Chat**: Payment details, personal documents, and other sensitive information are never exchanged directly in WhatsApp conversations
- **Audit Trail**: All link generation and access events are logged for security monitoring

### Secure Data Processing Workflow
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: WhatsApp is used only for communication and product discovery, while all sensitive data processing occurs exclusively on the secure web platform
- **Order Processing**: 
  - Orders are confirmed via WhatsApp but processed in the secure web platform
  - A secure time-limited link is sent to the customer to complete their order
  - Order details and confirmation are sent via email for record-keeping
  - WhatsApp receives only non-sensitive order confirmations
- **Invoice Handling**:
  - Invoices are never sent directly through WhatsApp
  - When a customer requests an invoice, the system sends a secure link to download it
  - Alternatively, invoices can be sent via email per customer preference
  - All invoice documents are password-protected PDFs for additional security
- **Payment Processing**:
  - All payments are processed exclusively through the secure web platform
  - Payment links sent via WhatsApp expire after one hour
  - Credit card and banking information is never requested or processed through WhatsApp
  - The system complies with PCI DSS requirements for payment handling
- **Data Isolation**:
  - The WhatsApp conversation system has no direct access to sensitive customer data
  - All sensitive data resides in isolated, encrypted database segments
  - Cross-system communication uses tokenized references rather than actual sensitive data

This strict separation ensures that sensitive customer information is never exposed in WhatsApp conversations, maintaining compliance with data protection regulations while still providing a seamless customer experience.

## COMPLIANCE AND PRIVACY

### GDPR Compliance
- **Data Minimization**: Only collecting necessary information for service operation
- **Lawful Processing**: Clear consent mechanisms for all data processing
- **Data Subject Rights**: Implementation of access, rectification, deletion, and portability rights
- **Records of Processing**: Maintaining documentation of all data processing activities
- **Privacy Notices**: Clear and accessible privacy information
- **Data Protection Impact Assessment**: Performed for high-risk processing activities
- **Data Breach Procedures**: Clear protocols for detecting, reporting, and handling breaches

### User Preference and Account Deletion
The platform provides complete self-service options for users to manage their accounts:

#### Preference Management
- Users can request a preference management link via WhatsApp
- Secure time-limited token (valid for 24 hours) for accessing preferences
- Users can modify personal details, language preference, currency preference, and notification settings

#### Account Deletion Process
- Clear "Delete My Account" option in the preferences page
- Two-step verification process including WhatsApp confirmation message
- Immediate deletion of personal identifiable information, chat history, and consent records
- Anonymized retention of order records and transaction history for legal and financial purposes
- 30-day grace period for account recovery

5. **Direct-to-Consumer Shift**: Brands increasingly selling directly to consumers rather than through marketplaces 

### Customer Registration Flow

1. Customer receives a WhatsApp message with a registration link
2. Customer clicks the link and is taken to a registration form
3. Customer fills out the form and submits
4. System validates the information and registers the customer
5. System sends a welcome message to the customer
6. System sends an after-registration message in the customer's preferred language to provide immediate assistance

#### After-Registration Messages

The system supports customizable after-registration messages with the following features:

- Messages are stored in workspace settings as `afterRegistrationMessages`
- Support for multiple languages (en, it, es, fr, de, pt)
- Dynamic insertion of the customer's first name using the `[nome]` placeholder
- Fallback to English if the customer's language is not supported
- Default messages if no custom message is configured

  "it": "Registrazione eseguita con successo. Ciao [nome], in cosa posso esserti utile oggi?",
  "es": "Registro completado con éxito. Hola [nome], ¿en qué puedo ayudarte hoy?"
}
```
